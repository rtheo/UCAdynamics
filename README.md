# UCAdynamics

Analysis of some internal symmetries of the original Unitary CA defined in Bialinycki-Birula original paper in Phys. Rev. D 49, 6920 (1994). Details on how to perform a 1D projection and use a sepctral representation for a fully analog implementation will be presented in a forthcoming publication.

Currently available:
A MAPLE worksheet with its pdf output and a plain text script file with the same material for the alternative freewares smib/eigenmath. SMIB is available from its sourceforge page http://smib.sourceforge.net. A MATLAB routine checkeig.m for chekcing against two different methods of diagonalizing the circulant kernels of the unfolded 3D lattice and LTLN,m for the study of Linear Transmission Line Network analog implementation of UCA cells.
